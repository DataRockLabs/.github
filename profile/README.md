## Our services
### Data engineering üíª
Data rocks. But it's often dirty, fragmented, and difficult to analyze. We can help you get the most out of your data by cleaning it up, organizing it, and making it easy to understand.
### Artifical intelligence ü§ñ
AI rocks. And the first steps are easy, but valuable AI services in production is a whole different ballgame, especially at enterprise scale. Our AI solutions are designed to provide reliable long-term support for your business processes.
### Business intelligence üìä
BI rocks. But it's completely useless if it isn't in the right place, at the right time, in the right format. We excel in extracting valuable insights from data, enabling informed decision-making and enhancing your business's efficiency.

## Our open-source contributions üåê
### [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations) üéØ
Great Expectations is a Python library that helps you write tests to validate data in your pipelines, ensuring that it meets your expectations. It allows you to **define expectations for various data sources and formats, such as databases, CSV files, or JSON files, and then run those expectations as tests**. This can be particularly useful in data engineering and data science workflows to ensure data quality and consistency throughout the pipeline. Great Expectations provides a flexible and expressive way to specify these expectations and integrate them seamlessly into your existing codebase.

### [Astronomer Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos)
Run your dbt Core projects as Apache Airflow DAGs and Task Groups with a few lines of code. Benefits include:

-   Run dbt projects against **Airflow connections instead of dbt profiles**
-   Native support for installing and **running dbt in a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts** with Airflow
-   **Run tests immediately after a model** is done to catch issues early
-   Utilize **Airflow‚Äôs data-aware scheduling** to run models immediately after upstream ingestion
-   Turn **each dbt model into a task/task group complete with retries, alerting, etc.**
